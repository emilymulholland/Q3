		<h1>Introducing Me</h1>
		<p><img src="images/me.jpg">		<img src="images/meandbrooke.jpg"></p>
		<p>My name is Emily Mulholland and I am 17 years old. I was born on November 22, 2002 (aka the best day of my parent's life), so I'm almost 18! I am a senior in high school at Saint Joes. I have gone to school here since the 6th grade and I've liked for the most part...how much can you really like school though?? Anyways, I have played basketball since I was little and I have always loved sports. I have done Youth In Government since the eighth grade and I even got accepted into Palmetto Girls State this past summer. I couldn't go because of stupid COVID :( I have two sisters, one older and one younger, and we are all really close. My little sister, Elaina, is a sophomore at SJCS, and my older sister, Caitlin, is a first year teacher at Hollis Elementary. My mom is a physical therapist at the Saint Francis offices downtown. I am on the Diocesan E-Team and I work at Tropical Grille.</p>

		<p>In the future 5 years I see myself in college at Clemson pursuing my career. I am not all the way sure what that is yet however. I will be almost graduating and they would have been the best 4 years ever. I will be a KD and a member of FCA. Hopefully I will have a good job and a boyfriend who I can marry soon.</p>

		<p>In the next  10 years, I see myself married with at least one kid already. We live in a beautiful house thats not too flashy. We live in either Greenville or Charleston. My husband and I both have good jobs and we travel often. I will either be in marketing or be an architect, but who's to say? Anyways, life will be good and happy. Oh and if everything works out, I will be driving a G-Wagon. </p>
